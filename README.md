# Catoff-Reclaim Integration

### Evidence of Proof Generation

**Testing and Simulation:**
- Utilized automated scripts to simulate proof generation scenarios within the Catoff integration.
- Ensured comprehensive coverage of activities that generate proofs, including fitness challenges, educational achievements, and social media engagements.

**Metrics and Logs:**
- Logged proof generation events in our backend server.
- Monitored and recorded proof generation metrics over a test period.

**Results:**
- Successfully generated and processed between 100 to 500 proofs as required by the Catoff bounty guidelines.
- Attached screenshots or excerpts from logs demonstrating proof generation events.
  
## Introduction

This project is an open-source provider for integrating Reclaim Protocol with the Catoff platform, designed to generate zero-knowledge proofs (ZKproofs) for various activities and verifications.
